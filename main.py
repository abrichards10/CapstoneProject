# Create a library instance 

# Create some books to put in the library 

# new_book = Book("Ready Player One", "Fred", 2016)
# new_book1 = Book("Ready Player One", "Fred", 2017)
# new_book2 = Book("Ready Player One", "Fred", 2018)
# new_book3 = Book("Ready Player One", "Fred", 2019)
# new_book4 = Book("Ready Player One", "Fred", 2020)


# print(new_book.title)
# print(new_book.author)
# print(new_book.year)

# (add the books to a list) --> add_book() (From our library class)
# [Book(""""""), Book(""""""), Book(""""")]

# (tricky part --> adding data via loops)

# Give the user some options for how to interact with the library 

# Based on the user input (update book, list books, add book) --> run the functions in their given files
